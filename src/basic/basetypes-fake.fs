module FStar.BaseTypes

(* When reading the F* sources as an F* program, you need to open BaseTypes to
 * get types such as int8 or int32. When reading the F* sources as an F#
 * program, you don't need to do this because these types already defined by F#.
 * (for an example see prettyprint/prettyprint.fsi which uses float)
 * *)
